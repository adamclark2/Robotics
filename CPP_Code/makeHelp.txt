To run a target type:

        make {target}
        
        Example:
        make help

Targets:
    build: build the code
    clean: remove binaries
    help: show this file
    run: build & run
    copy-code: copy the code over to the robot via SCP

Example:
    make copy-code
    ssh robot@ev3dev.local
    cd code
    make run

Gotcha's
    - Ensure the robot is connected to the internet via USB or Blutooth
    - Ensure the robot's network name is ev3dev.local
    - USB works faster
